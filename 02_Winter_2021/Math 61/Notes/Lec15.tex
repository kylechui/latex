  \begin{definition}{Linear Homogeneous Second Order Recurrence Relation}
    A \emph{linear homogeneous second order recurrence relation} with constant coefficients is a recurrence relation of the form
    \[
      c_n = ac_{n-1} + bc_{n-2} \tag{$a, b\in \R$}.
    \]
  \end{definition}
  \begin{example}{}
    The Fibonacci sequence is an example of a linear homogeneous second order recurrence relation.
  \end{example}
  \begin{definition}{Characteristic Polynomial}
    Given a LHSO recurrence relation
    \[
      c_n = ac_{n-1} + bc_{n-2} \tag{$a, b\in \R$},
    \]
    the \emph{characteristic polynomial} of the recurrence relation is $x^2 - ax - b$.
  \end{definition}
  \begin{note}{}
    If $f_n, g_n$ satisfy the LHSO $c_n = ac_{n-1} + bc_{n-2}$, then $af_n + bg_n$ satisfies the recurrence relation.
  \end{note}
  \begin{theorem}{Solutions to LHSO}
    If $c_n = ac_{n-1} + bc_{n-2}$ has characteristic polynomial with roots $r_1,r_2$, where $r_1\neq r_2$, then any solution is of the form
    \[
      c_n = er_1^n + fr_2^n. \tag{$e,f\in\R$}
    \]
    Everything of this form is a solution. If the characteristic polynomial has a repeated root $r$, then the solutions have the form
    \[
      c_n = er^n + fnr^n. \tag{$e,f\in\R$}
    \]
  \end{theorem}
  \section{Graphs}
  \begin{definition}{Undirected Graph}
    An \emph{undirected graph} is a pair of sets ($V, E$) where $V$ is the set of vertices, $E$ is the set of edges, and each edge $e\in E$ is associated with an unordered pair of vertices.
  \end{definition}
  \begin{definition}{Some Graph Terminology}
    The following terms are frequently used to describe basic graphs.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item loop---an edge connecting a vertex to itself
      \item parallel edges---two different edges with the same vertices
      \item \emph{simple graph}---graph with no loops nor parallel edges
      \item \emph{adjacent vertices}---vertices connected by an edge
      \item \emph{incident}---an edge $e$ is incident on a vertex $v$ if $e$ is connected to $v$
      \item \emph{weighted graph}---a graph where edges are labeled by non-negative real numbers
      \item directed graph---a graph where edges are associated with ordered pairs over vertices
    \end{itemize}
  \end{definition}
  \begin{note}{}
    A simple graph with vertex set $V$ is the same as a reflexive and symmetric relation on $V$.
