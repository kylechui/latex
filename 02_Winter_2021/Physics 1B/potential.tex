  \section{Electric Potential Energy and Voltage}
  You can store energy as electric potential energy and convert it back to kinetic energy on demand. To move a charge against the electric force generated by a capacitor, you need to perform work: $W = F\cdot d = (q\cdot E)\cdot d$. If you let the charge go, we have conservation of energy: $qEd = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$. \par
  All this is nice, but if you double the charge then you double the work and stored energy. To get a quantity that describes the energy storage capability of the field (that does not depend on $q$), we must define a new quantity. We say that \emph{electric potential} is defined by $V = \frac{U}{q}$. It is measured in $\frac{\mathrm{J}}{\mathrm{C}}$, or in volts ($\mathrm{V}$). For a homogeneous electric field, we have
  \[
    V = \frac{U}{q} = \frac{qEd}{q} = E\cdot d.
  \]
  \begin{note}{}
    Since we have $E = \frac{V}{d}$, we can measure electric field in $\frac{\mathrm{V}}{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{C}}$.
  \end{note}

  \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{c|c}
    Gravitational Potential Energy & Electric Potential Energy \\

    $U = mgh$ & $U = qEd$
  \end{tabular}\end{center}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Move a mass/charge against the field/force increases $U$ and $V$.
    \item Moving a mass/charge perpendicular to the field does not change $U$ and $V$.
    \item $V$ is a measure of how much energy a mass/charge would have at that point.
    \item Equipotential lines are perpendicular to the field. No work is done along those lines.
  \end{itemize}
  We define \emph{voltage} to be the potential difference between two points: $\Delta V = V_A - V_B$. Potential is a relative number but voltage is not. You must set the potential to zero somewhere (typically ground, one plate, or far away from a charge).
  \begin{note}{}
    Work performed by moving a charge $q$ in an electric field $E$ from point $A$ to point $B$ does not depend on the path taken. This is because both $F_g$ and $F_e$ are conservative forces.
  \end{note}
  \begin{definition}{Electric Potential Energy}
    We denote \emph{electric potential energy} by $U$ and it is given by
    \[
      U = W = -\int_{i}^{f}\vec{F} \dx \ell = -q \int_{i}^{f}\vec{E} \dx \ell.
    \]
  \end{definition}
  \begin{definition}{Electric Potential}
    We denote \emph{electric potential} by $V$ and it is given by
    \[
      V = -\int_{i}^{f}\vec{E} \dx \ell.
    \]
    It can also be found using $V = \frac{U}{q}$, but $V$ depends on the shape of the field.
  \end{definition}
  \begin{example}{Potential of a Point Charge} \\
    For a point charge (or sphere), the potential energy increases as you get closer to it. We can find the potential energy by integrating the force with respect to distance, yielding
    \begin{align*}
      W &= U \\
        &= -\int F\dx r \\
        &= -\int k\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}\dx r \\
        &= \frac{kQ_1Q_2}{r} + C.
    \end{align*}
    Thus the electric potential is $V = \frac{W}{q} = k\frac{Q}{r} + C$. We define the constant of integration to be zero when the radius approaches infinity.
  \end{example}
  Inside a conducting sphere, the field is zero so the potential stays constant. Outside the sphere however, it behaves just like a point charge so we have $V = k\frac{q}{r}$. \par
  We draw equipotential lines to designate what paths have constant electric potential. They are always perpendicular to the electric field lines.
  \begin{note}{}
    $V$ is a scalar field and only depends on $r$, but $E$ is a vector field---the direction of it depends on the angle.
  \end{note}
  \subsection{General Rules for Potential}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Moving a charge perpendicular to $E$ does not require work so $V$ does not change.
    \item $V$ increases as you move against $E$, and decreases as you move with $E$.
    \item If the field is zero then the potential remains constant.
    \item $V$ is only a relative number. We need to define where $V = 0$ (by grounding).
    \item A positive test charge wants to move to regions of smaller $V$, and a negative charge wants to move to regions of larger $V$.
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{example}{Mass Spectrometer} \\
    A mass spectrometer functions by ionizing particles and seeing how much they are deflected by a constant magnetic field (this will tell you the mass).
  \end{example}
  \subsection{Electric Potential In and Around a Conducting Cylinder}
  Outside of the charge, we have $\vec{E} = \frac{2k\lam}{\rho}\vec{a}_\rho$, where $\lam$ is the linear charge density. Inside the cylinder, the electric field is zero. Integrating along the radial path, we have
  \begin{align*}
    \Delta V &= -\int_{i}^{f}\vec{E}\cdot  \dx \vec{\rho} \\
             &= -2k\lam\int_{i}^{f}\frac{\mathrm{d}\rho}{\rho} \\
             &= -2k\lam\cdot \ln(\rho)|_{\rho_i}^{\rho_f} \\
             &= -2k\lam\cdot (\ln \rho_f - \ln\rho_i) \\
             &= \boxed{2k\lam\cdot \ln \paren{\frac{\rho_i}{\rho_f}}.}
  \end{align*}
  We set $V_i = 0$ at some arbitrary distance $\rho_0$. Then we have
  \[
    \boxed{V(\rho) = k\lam\cdot \ln \paren{\frac{\rho_0}{\rho}}.}
  \]
  \subsection{The Potential Gradient}
  We know that $\Delta V = -\int_{i}^{f}\vec{E}\cdot  \dx \vec{\ell}$, so we can find $E$ from $V$. For short distances $\Delta\ell$, it turns out that
  \[
    \Delta V = -\vec{E}\cdot \Delta\vec{\ell}.
  \]
  Thus $\Delta V = -E\cdot \Delta \ell\cdot \cos\theta$, so we have
  \[
    \boxed{\frac{\mathrm{d}V}{\mathrm{d}\ell} = -E\cdot \cos\theta.}
  \]
  In general for three-dimensions, we have
  \[
    \vec{\nab}V = -\vec{E}.
  \]
  \subsection{The Electric Field of a Dipole}
  We apply the principle of superposition. Thus the potential at point $P$ is 
  \[
    V = kQ \paren{\frac{1}{R_1}-\frac{1}{R_2}} = kQ \paren{\frac{R_2-R_1}{R_1R_2}}.
  \]
  If $P$ is very very far away from the dipole ($R \gg d$), then
  \[
    R_2 - R_1 = d\cdot \cos\theta.
  \]
  Thus we have
  \[
    V = \frac{kQd\cos\theta}{R_1R_2} = \frac{kQd\cos\theta}{r^2}.
  \]
  Plugging this into the formula we found in the earlier section, we have
  \[
    \vec{E} = \underbrace{\frac{kQd}{r^3}}_{\text{magnitude}}\underbrace{(2\cos\theta\cdot \vec{a}_r+\sin\theta\cdot \vec{a}_\theta)}_{\text{direction}}
  \]
  From this, we can see that $E\sim \frac{1}{r^3}$.
