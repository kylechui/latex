# Famous Person

A person `p` is *famous* in a population `P` (consisting of `n` people) if:

* `p` does not know anyone else in `P`
* Everyone else in `P` knows `p`

**Question**: How can we find a famous person in the population, if one exists?

<details> <!-- Brute Force -->

<summary>Solution 1</summary>

<h4>Algorithm</h4>

For every person in the population:

<ul>
  <li>
    Ask <code>p</code> if they know anybody else in <code>P</code>. If they do, then <code>p</code> is not famous
    and we move on to the next person
  </li>
  <li>
    Ask if everybody else in <code>P</code> knows <code>p</code>. If any one
    does not, then <code>p</code> is not famous and we move on to the next
    person
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Analysis</h4>

For the first person, we must ask `2n - 2` questions to determine whether or not
they are famous. For each subsequent person, this count drops by 2 since we have
eliminated the previous person. Adding this up for all `n` people yields that
this algorithm takes on the order of `n^2` steps.

<summary>Solution 2</summary>

<b>Idea.</b> We waste a lot of efforts on asking questions to pairs of people that
have already asked each other questions. Can we do better?

<h4>Algorithm</h4>

While there is more than one person left in the population:

<ul>
  <li>
    Arbitrarily choose two people, say <code>p</code> and <code>p'</code>, and
    ask if <code>p</code> knows <code>p'</code>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If <code>p</code> does know <code>p'</code>, then <code>p</code> cannot be famous, and so we remove them
      from our population
    </li>
    <li>
      If <code>p</code> does not know <code>p'</code>, then <code>p'</code> cannot be famous, and so we remove
      them from our population
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
Then go through one final time and ask if our final person knows anybody in the
original population, and vice versa to determine if they are famous.

<h4>Analysis</h4>

We eliminate the first `n - 1` people in `n - 1` questions, and then take `2n -
2` questions to ascertain whether the final person is famous or not. Hence this
algorithm runs in linear time.

# Stable Matching

Suppose we have two groups, `G` and `G'`. Each member of `G` has an *absolute*
(strict, no ties) and *complete* (contains everybody from `G'`) ranking for
everybody in `G'`, and vice versa for every member of `G'`.

We call a matching *unstable* if there exists some `a, b` in `G` and `a', b'` in
`G'` such that `a` is matched with `a'` and `b` is matched with `b'`, but
either:

* `a` and `b'` would prefer to be matched with each other over their current
  partners
* `b` and `a'` would prefer to be matched with each other over their current
  partners

We define a *stable matching* to be a matching where there exists no unstable
matches.

**Question**: How can we find a stable matching for the two groups, if one
exists?

# Egg Problem

You are on a staircase with `n` steps, and have a certain quantity of eggs on
you. You may drop an egg on any of the steps, and it will either stay intact or
break.

**Question**: Given some number of eggs, what is the minimum number of drops
necessary to find the first step on which the eggs will start breaking?

# Interval Scheduling

Suppose you have `n` errands to run, where the start and end times of the `i`th
errand are `l_i` and `r_i`, respectively. You cannot perform multiple errands
simultaneously.

**Question**: What is the maximum number of non-overlapping errands that you
can do?

<details> <!-- Brute Force -->
<summary>Brute Force</summary>

Construct the power set of the set of intervals and iterate through the subsets.
Then find the maximum number of intervals in any subset with no overlapping
intervals. Since we generate the power set, the time complexity of this method
is `O(2^n)`.

# Majority Vote

Suppose we have `m` candidates in an election, labeled `c_1` through `c_m`, and
`n` votes for the `m` candidates. A *majority* occurs when somebody wins
*strictly more than* `n/2` votes.

**Question**: Has anyone won a majority of the votes?

<details> <!-- Brute Force -->

<summary>Solution 1</summary>

We iterate from candidate `1` all the way through candidate `m`, and count how
many votes that candidate has won (by iterating through the votes). If we find a
majority, then we can stop looking. The runtime is hence `O(m*n)`.

</details>

<details> <!-- Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm -->

<summary>Solution 2</summary>

If we remove two *distinct* votes, then the majority is maintained (if it
exists). This is because you are guaranteed to remove <i>at most</i> one
majority element.

After many such removals of pairs, if we are left with one value, then we
perform another pass to check if it is the majority candidate. To do this we
keep track of the current potential majority candidate, and how many more times
we have seen it than not.

<h4>Algorithm</h4>

Keep track of a variable `count = 0` and iterate through the list:

<ul>
  <li>
    If <code>count == 0</code> then overwrite the potential majority and increment count.
  </li>
  <li>
    Else if the current element is the same as the potential majority,
    increment <code>count</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Otherwise the current element is different than the potential majority, so
    decrement <code>count</code>
  </li>
</ul>

If `count == 0` then there is no strict majority. Otherwise, take a final pass
through the votes and check if your potential majority is indeed your <i>actual</i> majority.

<h4>Analysis</h4>

As we only perform a constant number of computations for each vote, this
algorithm runs in `O(n)` time.

<ul>
  <li>
    There is at most one majority candidate
  </li>
  <li>

## Graphs

* Adjacency matrix representation
  * The vertices represent the rows and columns, and if you have an edge between
    two vertices the corresponding element in the matrix is set to a 1,
    otherwise 0
  * Undirected graphs are *symmetric*, directed graphs not necessarily so
* Adjacency list representation
  * From each vertex, you have a linked list to all of its neighbors

### Breadth First Search

We traverse each edge twice, and every vertex once. Hence the time complexity is
`O(e + n)`.

* If the graph is connected, `O(e)` â‰¥ `O(n)` and we may simplify it to
  `O(e)`
* If the graph is disconnected, we modify the algorithm to "jump" when we run
  out of nodes in the current component. We stop only when we have successfully
  marked all nodes
* Can be used to generate a minimal spanning tree (BFS Tree)
  * The edges in this tree are called *primary edges*, with all other edges
    being *secondary*

### Depth First Search

Again, we traverse each edge twice, and every vertex once. Hence the time
complexity is `O(e + n)`.

### Shortest Distance Algorithm

Given two vertices `u` and `v` in a graph, find the *distance* (length of a
shortest path) between them.

<details>

<summary>Solution 1</summary>

The shortest path from `u` to `v` is the level of `v` with respect to `u`'s
BFS tree.
