  \section{Lecture 2}
  \begin{definition}{Magnetic field}
    The \emph{magnetic field} is denoted by $\vec{B}$, and its units are given in Tesla (which is a large unit!).
  \end{definition}
  \subsection{Demonstrations}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A current through a magnetic field experiences a force (the jumping wire). The force $\vec{F}$ was perpendicular to the magnetic field $\vec{B}$, which was perpendicular to the current $\vec{I}$.
    \item The lodestone is a magnet.
    \item Opposite poles attract, same poles repel (bar magnets).
    \item We visualised the magnetic field by looking at the alignment of iron filings in a viscous fluid.
  \end{itemize}
  \subsection{Equations}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The force due to a magnetic field is given by
    \[
      \vec{F}_m = q\vec{v}\times \vec{B}.
    \]
    This force is a part of the electromagnetic force, 
    \[
      \vec{F}_{EM} = q\vec{E} + q\vec{v}\times \vec{B}.
    \]
    \begin{note}{Cross Products}
      Suppose we have two vectors $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$. Then $\vec{a}\times \vec{b}$ is a vector perpendicular to both $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$. If $\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors, then
      \[
        \abs{\vec{a}\times \vec{b}} = \abs{\vec{a}}\abs{\vec{b}}\sin\theta = ab\sin\theta.
      \]
      The direction of the vector is given by the ``right hand rule''.
    \end{note}
  \end{enumerate}
