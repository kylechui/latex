  \subsection{Plane Mirrors and Images}
  The way images work is that our brain perceives incoming light rays reflecting off of a mirror the same way as it would perceive an object on the other side of the mirror. We can find the location of the image by tracing the light rays backwards through the mirror to see where they converge. For a plane mirror, the image distance is the same as the object distance (which can be shown with basic geometry). \par
  For multiple mirrors, we can either try finding the end result all at once via ray-tracing or we can find the ``image of the image''.
  \subsection{Concave Focusing Mirror}
  Let $R$ be the radius of curvature of our spherical mirror.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If light comes from the centre of curvature, all the light coming from the source will reflect perfectly back to the source.
    \item If light is coming from infinitely far away, then the incoming light rays would all be parallel. The rays converge on the line from the centre to the mirror, parallel to the incoming rays, halfway between the centre of curvature and the mirror.
  \end{enumerate}
