  \section{Lecture 5}
  Last week, we studied the force due to a $\vec{B}$. This week, we will study how to produce a $\vec{B}$.
  \subsection{Biot-Savart Law}
  Point charge observations:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item When you have a point charge, you have an electric field $\vec{E}$ that radiates outwards from the point charge.
    \item This is slightly different from the magnetic field, which is generated by a \emph{moving} point charge.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The closer you are to the point charge, the larger the magnetic field.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{theorem}{Coulomb's Law}
    Given the charge and distance from a point charge, we may find the electric field:
    \[
      \vec{E} = \frac{q\hat{r}}{4\pi\eps_0r^2}.
    \]
  \end{theorem}
  Biot-Savart Law precursor:
  \[
    \vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\cdot \frac{q\vec{v}\times\hat{r}}{r^2}.
  \]
  \begin{note}{}
    In the equation for the magnetic field, we see that it is both orthogonal to the velocity vector and $\hat{r}$ (due to the cross product).
  \end{note}
  Points:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Both are inversely proportional to the square of the distance.
    \item $\mu_0 \ceq 4\pi\cdot 10^{-7}$ Tm/A, and is used in the definition of the ampere (and so the Coulomb).
    \begin{note}{}
      This means that the $\vec{E}$ is very large, but $\vec{B}$ is quite small.
    \end{note}
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{theorem}{Biot-Savart Law}
    Given the current through a wire, and the displacement from a point to the wire, we can find the magnetic field:
    \[
      \mathrm{d}\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{I\mathrm{d}\vec{\ell}\times\hat{r}}{r^2}.
    \]
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{center}\resizebox{6cm}{!}{\import{./figures}{Lecture5D1.pdf_tex}}\end{center}
  In the above diagram, you can see how the cross product of $\mathrm{d}\vec{\ell}$ and $\vec{r}$ is in the direction of the magnetic field. Furthermore, we can integrate the Biot-Savart Law to get
  \[
    \vec{B} = \int_\text{wire} \mathrm{d}\vec{B}
  \]
  \subsection{Magnetic Field of a Straight Current-Carrying Wire}
  For a long, straight current-carrying wire, we try to find the field on some point $P$ from locations $-a$ to $a$ on the wire.
  \begin{center}\resizebox{4cm}{!}{\import{./figures}{Lecture5D2.pdf_tex}}\end{center}
  We can see that $r = (x^2 + y^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}$, and
  \[
    \hat{r} - \frac{x\hat{\imath} - y\hat{\jmath}}{(x^2+y^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}}. \tag{Scale down $\vec{r}$}
  \]
  Furthermore, $\mathrm{d}\vec{\ell}= \mathrm{d}y\hat{\jmath}$. The hard part is calculating the following:
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{\ell}\times \hat{r}}{r^2} &= \frac{\mathrm{d}y\hat{\jmath}\times (x\hat{\imath}-y\hat{\jmath})}{(x^2 + y^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \\
                                                   &= \frac{-\hat{k}x\,\mathrm{d}y}{(x^2+y^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}.
  \end{align*}
  We then integrate over the length of the wire:
  \begin{align*}
    \vec{B} &= -\hat{k} \frac{\mu_0I}{4\pi} \int_{-a}^{a} \frac{x\,\mathrm{d}y}{(x^2+y^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}
    \intertext{Letting $y = x\tan\theta$, and going through some algebra, we get}
            &= -\hat{k} \frac{\mu_0I}{4\pi}\paren{\frac{2a}{x \sqrt{a^2+x^2}}}.
  \end{align*}
  For an infinitely long wire, we see what happens when $a\to \infty$. In this case, we have
  \[
    \vec{B} = -\hat{k} \frac{\mu_0I}{4\pi} \paren{\frac{2}{x}} = -\hat{k} \frac{\mu_0I}{2\pi x}.
  \]
  We started with a special point $P$ on the wire, which is on the perpendicular bisector of the wire. However, when $a\to\infty$, we have an infinite amount of wire on either side, so the $y$ becomes irrelevant and all we care about is the distance $x$ to the wire. Thus to find the magnitude of the wire, we have
  \[
    B = \frac{\mu_0I}{2\pi r},
  \]
  where $r$ is the distance to the wire. If we were to look at the wire from the top (the $xz$-plane), we would have that $\vec{B}$ circles the wire.
  \begin{note}{}
    Another right-hand rule is to put your thumb in the direction of the current, and your thumbs will curl to form the magnetic field.
  \end{note}
