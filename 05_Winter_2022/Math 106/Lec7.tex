  \section{Lecture 7}
  In the 19\tsup{th} century, mathematicians started to develop ``non-Euclidean'' geometries by adjusting the 5\tsup{th} postulate. \par
  \textbf{Fact.} Assuming the first four postulates, the fifth postulate is equivalent to the following: ``In a plane, there exactly one line parallel to a given line through a given point''.
  \paragraph{Adjustments}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
    \item There are no such lines (spherical geometry)
    \item There are more than one such lines (hyperbolic geometry)
  \end{enumerate}
  \subsection{The Regular Polyhedra (the Platonic Solids)}
  There are the:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Tetrahedron
    \item Cube
    \item Octahedron
    \item Dodecahedron
    \item Icosahedron
  \end{itemize}
  As far as we know, they were the first entirely described and proven that they are the only regular solids by Theaetetos, circa 400 BCE.
  \begin{note}{}
    If you take a regular polyhedron and create new vertices at the center of each face, you can construct another regular polyhedron.
  \end{note}
  Via the above described method, you can construct the octahedron from the cube.
