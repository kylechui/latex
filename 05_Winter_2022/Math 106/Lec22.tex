  \section{Lecture 22}
  \subsection{Al-Karaji c. 953--1029}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Considered the first person to free algebra from geometric interpretations
    \item Defined the abstract monomials $\dotsc,x^{-2},x^{-1},x,x^2,\dotsc$
    \item He found the following rules:
    \[
      x^nx^m = x^{n + m}\quad\text{for all integers }n, m.
    \]
    \begin{note}{}
      He most likely did not realize that $x^0 = 1$.
    \end{note}
    \item He was the first to use (a rudimentary form of) proof by induction
    \begin{note}{}
      He usually just performed the computation for a few examples of small $n$, and then stated that it could be done similarly for all other $n$.
    \end{note}
  \end{itemize}
  \subsection{Omar Khayyam (1048--1131)}
  He was the first mathematician to solve the cubic equation in full generality!
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The method that he used was entirely geometric and relied on intersections of conic sections
    \item A purely algebraic method was found 500 years later by Italian mathematicians del Ferro and Tartaglia
  \end{itemize}
  \subsection{Symmetries}
  There was significant progress in geometry, in particular relating to symmetry.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item One of the reasons for this was the Islamic prohibition on depicting the human form, so complex geometric structures were used as decorations.
    \item They established that there are exactly 17 symmetries in the plane, called wallpaper symmetries
  \end{itemize}
