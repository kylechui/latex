  \section{Lecture 23}
  \subsection{Medieval Europe}
  \subsubsection{Leonardo di Pisa (Fibonacci), c. 1170--1250}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Not much is known, but we know he traveled through North Africa, learning Arabic mathematics
    \item He picked up the Hindu-Arabic number system, and promoted their use in his book ``Liber Abaci''
    \item Still took a while for the number system to prevail over the Roman numerals
    \item The famous ``Fibonacci sequence'' plays only a very minor role in his works
  \end{itemize}
  The sequence is defined by
  \[
    F_{n + 1} = F_n + F_{n - 1}.
  \]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item He was neither the first to describe ``his'' sequence, nor did he describe any special properties associated with it
    \item It was the first time an infinite, recursively defined sequence was studied in Europe
    \item He described the sequence as representing a hypothetical population of rabbits
    \item It has many interesting results, such as that it always has the pattern odd, odd, even
    \item It appears surprisingly often in nature, and is a popular ratio in art
    \item The sequence is intimately related with the \emph{golden ratio}, given by
    \[
      \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{F_{n + 1}}{F_n} = \varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
    \]
    \item There is a closed-form equation for the Fibonacci numbers:
    \[
      F_n = \frac{(1 + \sqrt{5})^n - (1 - \sqrt{5})^n}{2^n\sqrt{5}}.
    \]
  \end{itemize}
  \subsubsection{Early Renaissance}
  There were the first recorded uses of some standard modern notations, like $\cdot$ for multiplication or $\sqrt{}$ for taking roots. \par
  The cubic and quartic were completely solved by Italian mathematicians Tartaglia, Cardano, and Ferrari.
  \subsubsection{Age of Reason}
  The 17\tsup{th} century saw a lot of mathematical and scientific progress across Europe.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Scientists made many advancements in astronomy, like Kepler's laws
    \item John Napier invented the logarithm in the early 17\tsup{th} century, which made many future accomplishments possible
    \item Other important names include Descartes, Fermat, Newton, Leibniz, etc.
  \end{itemize}
