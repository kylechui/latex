  \subsection{Newton's Divided Difference}
  As long as you are interpolating the same $n$ points, you will always get the same polynomial if you use any of the methods studied before. \par
  This method is similar to Neville's method in the sense that it is iterative, and the procedure is as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item First find $P_0(x) = f(x_0)$.
    \item We interpolate $(x_1, f(x_1))$ by writing
    \[
      P_1(x) = P_0(x) + a_1(x - x_0),
    \]
    for some $a_1$ such that $P_1(x_1) = f(x_1)$.
    \item We interpolate $(x_2, f(x_2))$ by writing
    \[
      P_2(x) = P_1(x) + a_2(x - x_0)(x - x_1),
    \]
    for some $a_2$ such that $P_2(x_2) = f(x_2)$.
    \item Hence we have
    \begin{align*}
      P_n(x) &= P_{n - 1}(x) + a_n(x - x_0)\dotsb(x - x_{n - 1}) \\
             &= f(x_0) + a_1(x - x_0) + \dotsb + a_{n - 1}(x - x_0)\dotsb(x - x_{n - 2}) + a_n(x - x_0)\dotsb(x - x_{n - 1}).
    \end{align*}
    It remains to find these coefficients $a_i$ for $i\in 0,\dotsc,n$.
  \end{itemize}
