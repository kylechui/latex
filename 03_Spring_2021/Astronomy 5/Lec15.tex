  \section{Lecture 15}
  \subsection{Results From Doppler Shift}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Period and semi-major axis
    \item Eccentricity of orbit
    \item Faster oscillations on top of slower variations implies multiple planets
    \item Mass, although with a caveat (the Doppler shift only provides velocity along our line of sight)
    \begin{note}{}
      Thus the planet mass deduced is a lower limit for the actual mass of the planet. In 2/3 cases, the \emph{true} mass is no more than double the Doppler mass.
    \end{note}
  \end{itemize}
  The Doppler technique is best suited for finding massive planets that orbit close to their stars---the Doppler effect is more visible. Using Doppler mass and getting the size from transit observations, one can calculate the density.
  \subsection{Other Strategies}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Gravitational lensing---A planet bends light towards the observer and produces extra brightening (only mass can be measured)
    \item Look for the effects of planets on disks of dust
    \item White dwarfs can have bands of metals (if other things collide with it)
  \end{itemize}
  The \emph{Earth similarity index} is a function of all the parameters of a planet, and compares other worlds to Earth. \par
  A star's \emph{full classification} includes \emph{spectral type} (line identities that yield temperature) and \emph{luminosity class} (line shapes related to the size of the star).
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Roman*)]
    \item Super giant
    \item Bright giant
    \item Giant
    \item Sub giant 
    \item Main sequence
  \end{enumerate}
  For example, the Sun is classified by ``G2 V'', and Betelgeuse by ``M2 I''.
