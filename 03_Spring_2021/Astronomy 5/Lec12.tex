  \section{Lecture 12}
  \subsection{The Moons of the Outer Solar System}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item In $1610$, Galileo discovered four objects that were orbiting Jupiter
    \item Moons of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune soon followed 
    \item Jovian moons differ enormously in size, composition, density, atmospheres, and more
    \item Ganymede and Titan are larger than Mercury, while other moons are tiny misshapen mountains
  \end{itemize}
  \subsubsection{What kinds of Moons orbit the Jovian Planets}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Medium and large moons probably formed at the same time as their planets
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Enough self-gravity to be \emph{spherical}
      \item Are or were geologically active
      \item Have substantial amounts of ice
      \item Formed in orbit around Jovian planets
      \item Circular orbits in the \emph{same} direction as the planet rotation (likely due to accretion)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Small moons are mostly \emph{captured} asteroids and comets
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Far more numerous than medium-large moons
      \item Not spherical
      \item Orbits can be tilted, elliptical, and even backwards
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \subsection{Galilean Moons}
  \begin{note}{}
    They have very few craters and have white spots---they are geologically active.
  \end{note}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Io has active volcanoes (the most geologically active)
    \item Europa may have a subsurface ocean of warm water
    \item Ganymede and Callisto may also have subsurface oceans
  \end{itemize}
  Smaller worlds can be geologically active by \emph{tidal heating}, where they are squished and stretched by their planet's gravitational pull. For example, Io and Europa are tidally heated.
  \subsubsection{Europa}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Energy source? Sun's energy is decreased due to distance
    \item Tidal energy and rock/water interface might fuel redox reactions and provide energy for 10\tsup{5} kg of biomass
    \item Pressure at the rocky bottom of the oceans likely are too high for cell walls to exist (much deeper than Earth)
    \item Radiation from Jupiter radiation belts might split molecules of water, enabling creation of OH and other energy-releasing chemical reactions
    \item This could bathe the upper few metres of water under the ice in nutrients; life protected from radiation at depths greater than $1$ metre
  \end{itemize}
  \subsubsection{Ganymede}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The largest moon in the solar system
    \item Clear evidence of geological activity
    \item Tidal heating not as effective, probably additional heat due to radioactive decay
  \end{itemize}
  \subsubsection{Callisto}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item ``Classic'' cratered ice ball
    \item Older surface
    \item No tidal heating, because no orbital resonance
    \item It has a magnetic field---often an indication of sub-surface water
    \item Could Jupiter have three water worlds?
  \end{itemize}
  \subsection{Titan}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item It is made of 90\% nitrogen, the rest is argon, methane, ethane, and other hydrogen compounds
    \item Methane and ethane are greenhouse gases
    \item Chemical reactions on Titan could produce organic chemicals
    \item Methane rain
    \item Cassini/Huygens space mission (2005) gave us first look at Titan's surface (liquid methane lakes and ``rocks'' made of ice)
  \end{itemize}
  \subsection{Neptune's Moon Triton}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Similar to Pluto, but larger
    \item Probably a captured object from the Kuiper belt (opposes Neptune's orbit)
  \end{itemize}
