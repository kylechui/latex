  \section{Lecture 13}
  \subsection{Life in the Solar System Beyond Earth}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Mars is the best place to search
    \item Water on Europa and Enceladus has been confirmed
    \item Various factors---chemical energy sources are questionable, high pressures at the base of Europa ocean make life questionable
    \item Venus' atmosphere or Jovian atmospheres?
    \item Titan is probably too cold to host life as we know it
    \item Life precursors like complex organics are identified in meteorites
  \end{itemize}
  We still don't know where life came from on Earth---we know that DNA is the basis for all life and undersea vents are a good place to start, but there is no consensus nor key evidence.
  \subsection{Searching for Past Life on Mars}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Cameras will search for fossilized structures like stromatolites
    \item Other instruments will measure composition of rocks and minerals
    \item Samples will be cached and returned to Earth in the 2030s
  \end{enumerate}
  \subsubsection{Potential Problems}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Origin of Mars ``blueberries''---hematite
    \item Does the hematite have a biological origin?
    \item Finding minerals that require water to form does not prove that life existed
    \item Organised structures can have a non-biological origin
    \item Sample return is the only certain way to search for life
    \item Potentially Martian meteorites as well
  \end{itemize}
  \subsection{Habitable Zones}
  \begin{definition}{Habitable Zone}
    The range of distances at which worlds similar to Earth could exist.
  \end{definition}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Existing within a star's habitable zone is insufficient
    \item Stars brighten as they age, shifting the habitable zone
    \item Whether a planet can possibly have water is dependent on the atmosphere
  \end{itemize}
  \subsubsection{Life Outside the Habitable Zone}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item In principle, life can exist outside the habitable zone
    \item Europa, Ganymede, and Enceladus provide us evidence of liquid water heated via non-solar means
    \item Rogue planets number in the billions
    \item Titan could give possible conditions for life, but is outside the habitable zone
  \end{itemize}
  \subsubsection{Venus: An Example in Potential Habitability}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Venus receives twice the solar energy that the Earth does
    \item Moving Earth to Venus' orbital distance would increase global temperatures by $30^\circ$ C
    \item The worlds are similar, but Venus' greenhouse gas effect is too extreme
    \item Venus probably lost its water due to solar winds
    \begin{itemize}
      \item There is evidence for this water loss---there is $100$ times more deuterium in Venus' atmosphere compared to Earth's atmosphere
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \subsubsection{Runaway Greenhouse Effect}
  Evaporation leads to water vapour which leads to even more greenhouse effect
  \subsubsection{Surface Habitability Factors}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Stellar factor---Luminosity of a star determines the radius of the habitable zone
    \item Planetary factor---A world must be large enough to retain internal heat and have plate tectonics for climate regulation
    \item Atmospheric factor---A world must have an atmosphere to retain liquid surface water (might imply magnetic field)
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{note}{}
    The habitable zone changes with time because stars get brighter and dimmer in their lifetimes.
  \end{note}
