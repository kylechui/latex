  \section{Lecture 27}
  \subsection{Focal Length Equation}
  \begin{theorem}{Focal Length Equation}
    If the distance from the mirror/lens to the object is given by $s$, and the distance to the image is denoted $s'$, then
    \[
      \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{s} + \frac{1}{s'},
    \]
    where $f$ is the focal length.
  \end{theorem}
  \subsection{Ray Diagrams}
  For a converging lens, we draw three rays to find the image of an object. The rays all start from the tip of the object, and are as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Parallel to the axis, then to the far focus
    \item Through the centre of the lens
    \item To the near focus, then parallel
  \end{enumerate}
  We define magnification by 
  \[
    m = \frac{h'}{h} = -\frac{s'}{s}.
  \]
  The negative takes into account the fact that the image is inverted.
  \subsection{Optics Sign Rules}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item When the object is on the same side of the reflecting/refracting surface as the incoming light, the object distance $s$ is positive, otherwise negative
    \item When the image is on the same side of the reflecting/refracting surface as the outgoing light, the image distance $s'$ is positive, otherwise negative
    \item When the centre of curvature $C$ is on the same side as the outgoing light, the radius of curvature is positive, otherwise negative
  \end{enumerate}
