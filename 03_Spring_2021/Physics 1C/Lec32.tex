  \section{Lecture 32}
  \subsection{Triple-slit Phasors}
  If each vector has magnitude $E_0$ and is an angle $\phi$ relative to the previous vector, then we have a few special cases:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\phi = 0$ \\
    The vectors are all in the same direction, so
    \[
      E_p = 3E_0. \tag{maximum}
    \]
    \item $\phi = \frac{2\pi}{3}$ \\
    The vectors rotate to form an equilateral triangle, so
    \[
      E_p = 0.
    \]
    \item $\phi = \pi$ \\
    The first two vectors cancel, leaving the last one, so
    \[
      E_p = E_0. \tag{2\tsup{nd} maximum}
    \]
  \end{itemize}
  \subsection{Diffraction Gratings}
  As a function of $\phi$, you have constructive interference where $\phi = \pm m\cdot 2\pi$, and destructive interference where $\phi = \frac{2\pi}{N}$. If you only have a single slit, you can still have destructive interference when $d\sin\theta = \frac{\lam}{2}$ (which can be shown using a picture).
  \subsection{Thin-Film Interference}
  For a thin film, the waves that are reflected at material boundaries may be phase-shifted. The rules are as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If $n_a > n_b$, then the reflected wave is not phase shifted at all relative to the incident wave
    \item If $n_a = n_b$, then there is effectively no interface, so there is no reflected wave
    \item If $n_a < n_b$, then the reflected wave is phase shifted by $\pi$, and is out of phase with the incident wave
  \end{itemize}
  This is particularly useful for computing for constructive or destructive interference. After taking into account these phase shifts, we have
  \begin{align*}
    2t &= m\lam_n \tag{Constructive} \\
    2t &= \paren{m+\frac{1}{2}}\lam_n \tag{Destructive}
  \end{align*}
  where $t$ is the thickness of the medium and $\lam_n$ is the wavelength of the light inside the medium, given by $\lam_n = \frac{\lam_0}{n}$. The reason why $t$ is doubled here is because the wave that passes through the medium and makes it to the other side must then travel through the medium yet again after being reflected.
