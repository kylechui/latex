  \subsection{Motional EMF---Conductors Moving in Magnetic Fields}
  See the diagram in section 9.4. From the Lorentz force equation, we have
  \[
    \vec{F} = q\vec{v}\times \vec{B}.
  \]
  The electric field generated by the separation of charges (positives to the top, negatives to the bottom) in the conductor will create a force equal to and opposing the magnetic force. In other words, 
  \[
    \vec{F}_E = q\vec{E} = -q\vec{v}\times \vec{B} = -\vec{F}_M,
  \]
  so $\vec{E} = -\vec{v}\times \vec{B}$. If the conductor is connected to metal rails, we see that this electric field will actually send the charges through the loop. The magnitude of this EMF is given by $\eps = BLv$, which agrees with what we got in section 9.4. \par
  We can generalise this to an arbitrary loop of wire with segments all moving in random directions, by cutting the loop up into small segments of length $\mathrm{d}\vec{\ell}$ and integrating:
  \[
    \eps = \oint (\vec{v}\times \vec{B})\,\mathrm{d}\vec{\ell}.
  \]

    \caption{Magnet Falling Through a Conducting Tube}
  \end{figure}
  Notice that as the magnet falls, the magnetic flux through the area $A$ is increasing upwards. By Lenz's Law, there will be an induced magnetic field pointing downwards, opposing the change in magnetic flux. This induced magnetic field exerts a force on the magnet, causing it to slow down and fall through the tube more slowly. As the tube gets thicker and more conductive, the eddy currents and induced magnetic field also get larger, causing the magnet to fall even more slowly.
