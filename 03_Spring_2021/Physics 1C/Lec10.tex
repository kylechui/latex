  \subsection{Lenz's Law, Eddy Currents}
  This is useful for determining the sign and direction of things in a system involving magnetic fields/forces.
  \begin{note}{}
    When changing a magnetic system, forces and currents act in the direction to \emph{oppose} the change.

    \caption{Pulling a Loop of Wire out of a Magnetic Field}
  \end{figure}
  As you pull the loop of wire out of the magnetic field that is into the page, the area of the loop that is in the constant magnetic field will decrease. Thus the loop of wire will have an induced current such that it will generate more field into the page. By the right-hand rule, we can see that the induced current should run clockwise. Furthermore, the magnetic forces on the top and bottom portions of the wire are equal and in opposite directions, and so cancel out. There is a force on the left part of the loop that is pointing to the left, which opposes the force that is pulling the loop out of the magnetic field.
