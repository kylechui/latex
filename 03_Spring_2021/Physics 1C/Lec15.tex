  \subsection{Why Would We Want an RLC Circuit?}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item RLC Circuits are useful when you want to generate a specific frequency \emph{or} you want to select a specific frequency.
    \begin{note}{}
      Used in cell phones, internet, TV, radio, etc. for receiving and transmitting.
    \end{note}
    \item There is always some resistance in a circuit.
    \item Electrical Engineering: All circuits also have capacitance and inductance.
    \item Damped oscillation
  \end{enumerate}
  \subsection{RLC Circuits---Damped Oscillation}
  Suppose that at time $t = 0$, we close the circuit such that the charged capacitor, resistor, and inductor are in series. When the RLC circuit is underdamped, we get
  \[
    - \frac{q}{c} - iR - L\cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}i}{\mathrm{d}t} = 0.
  \]
  Substituting $i = \frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}t}$, we have
  \[
    L\cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^2q}{\mathrm{d}t^2} + \underbrace{R\cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}t}}_{\mathclap{\text{damping term}}} + \frac{1}{c}\cdot q = 0.
  \]
  The general solution to this differential equation is given by
  \[
    q(t) = q_0e^{-\frac{t}{2L/R}}\cos (\omega t + \phi),
  \]
  where $\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC} - \paren{\frac{R}{2L}}^2}$.
  \begin{note}{}
    You have two parameters in the above equation, namely $q_0$ and $\phi$.
  \end{note}
