## CPUs

* CPU images are colorful because there are many different materials
* They consist of billions of transistors (logic gates are made of transistors)

## What is a System?

* Something that transforms some input to an output

<!-- Definition: Digital System -->

> **Digital System:** A system that takes a finite number of discrete values

<!-- Definition: Analog System -->

> **Analog System:** A system that takes an infinite number of values
> (continuous)

## Why Digital?

* Analog systems require an infinite amount of memory (since there are infinite
  possible values)
* Both numerical and non-numerical information processing
* Information processing can use a general-purpose system (a computer)
* Digital representation
  * We can convert all signals to a binary representation
* Digital systems are more resilient to noise
* Numerical systems can easily be made *more accurate* by increasing the number
  of digits used in the representation
* Phenomenal advances in micro-electronics:
  * Very complex digital systems are small, fast, cheap
  * Digital systems are composed of a large number of simpler integrated
    circuits
* Different implementations of hardware can have trade-offs in speed and cost

## High-level Specification

* We need the input set, output set, and input-output function

## Combinational and Sequential Systems

* Combinational systems don't have memory, and the output doesn't depend on
  previous inputs
* In sequential systems, the output depends on previous computations, i.e. the
  system has *memory*
