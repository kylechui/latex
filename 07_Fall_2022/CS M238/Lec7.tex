  \subsection{Simon's Problem}
  Suppose we have some function $f\colon \set{0, 1}^n\to \set{0, 1}^n$. We assume that there exists some $s\in\set{0, 1}^n$ such that for all $x, y\in \set{0, 1}^n$, we have $f(x) = f(y)$ if and only if $x + y\in \set{0^n, s}$. We wish to find $s$.
  \subsection{Simon's Algorithm}
  The high-level idea here is that we use a quantum computer to map $f$ to a series of equations, and then use classical computers to find $s$. Since this is a probabilistic computation, we repeat this process until we're ``fairly certain'' that we have found $s$.
  \begin{note}{}
    It is very easy to check if a given guess $s$ is a valid solution to the problem. We can just choose an arbitrary $x$ and compare $f(x)$ with $f(x\oplus s)$.
  \end{note}
  After running the quantum computer, we will end up with $n - 1$ equations of the form
  \begin{align*}
    y_1\cdot s &= 0 \\
    y_2\cdot s &= 0 \\
    \vdots \\
    y_{n - 1}\cdot s &= 0.
  \end{align*}
  Ideally we wish all $y_i$ to be linearly independent, so $s$ is orthogonal to the $n - 1$ bit strings. The probability that all of the $y_i$'s are linearly independent is greater than $\frac{1}{4}$.
