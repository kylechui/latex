  \section{Lecture 3}
  Another tablet titled ``YBC7289'' contains approximations for $\sqrt{2}$ and $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ that has an error of less than $1$ in $2$ million.
  \subsection{Greek Mathematics}
  \begin{note}{}
    A lot of ``Greek'' mathematicians did not come from what is nowadays Greece, but rather the old Hellenistic empire (which was larger).
  \end{note}
  \subsubsection{The Theorem of Pythagoras}
  Probably the oldest ``mathematical theorem'', known (in some form) to:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Egyptians
    \item Babylonians
    \item Chinese
    \item Indians
    \item Greeks
  \end{itemize}
  \emph{before} Pythagoras.
  \paragraph{What we know about Pythagoras with (quasi-)certainty}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item He existed (\tilde $580$ BCE--$500$ BCE)
    \item He was born in Samos (modern day Turkey)
    \item He left no writings himself
    \item He founded a school in Croton (c. $540$ BCE)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item We say ``school'' but it was more like a sect, with strict rules and secrecy
      \item Their central belief was ``All is number'', and that every number has a meaning
      \item The number $10$ was a ``holy number'', often drawn as a triangle
      \item Theory of music based on whole fractions
      \item Largely responsible for introducing ``rigorous'' mathematics
      \item They viewed ``pure'' mathematics as the opposite of ``applied'' mathematics
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{theorem}{Pythagorean Theorem}
    Given a right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$ and hypotenuse $c$, we have
    \[
      a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
    \]
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{definition}{Pythagorean Triples}
    Triples $(a, b, c)$ that satisfy $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ are called \emph{Pythagorean triples}.
  \end{definition}
  \textbf{General Formula:} For positive integers $p, q, r$ such that $p\geq q$, we can use the following equations:
  \begin{align*}
    a &= (p^2 - q^2)r \\
    b &= 2pqr \\
    c &= (p^2 + q^2)r
  \end{align*}
  \paragraph{``Facts'':}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Less general formulas were known to Pythagoras' school, Plato, Babylonians...
    \item The first statement \emph{and} proof of this formula is from Euclid's ``Elements'', book 10
  \end{itemize}
  \subsubsection{Rational points on the circle}
  Finding rational points on the unit circle with rational coordinates is actually very related to finding Pythagorean triples.
