  \section{Lecture 20}
  \subsection{Rational Triangles}
  \begin{definition}{Rational Triangle}
    A triangle is \emph{rational} if the sides and area are both rational.
  \end{definition}
  \begin{note}{}
    Equivalently, if all sides and the height on any side is rational then the triangle is rational.
  \end{note}
  Not all triangles with rational sides have rational area, i.e. the unit equilateral triangle.
  \begin{note}{}
    Any three rational numbers $a, b, c$ such that the sum of any two is larger than the third gives a triangle with rational sides.
  \end{note}
  Brahmagupta found that every rational triangle has sides that can be expressed in the following form:
  \begin{align*}
    a &= \frac{u^2 + v^2}{2} \\
    b &= \frac{u^2 + w^2}{2} \\
    c &= \frac{u^2 - v^2}{2} + \frac{u^2 - w^2}{2} \\
    h &= 2u,
  \end{align*}
  where $u, v, w$ are rational. \par
  \textbf{Idea.}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Use Pythagorean Theorem to show that $c_1,c_2$ are rational
    \item Find a formula for \emph{right-angled} rational triangles
  \end{enumerate}
